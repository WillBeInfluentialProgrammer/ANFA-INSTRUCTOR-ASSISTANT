**ANFA  INSTRUCTOR'S ASSISTANT**
ANFA Instructor Assistant is an AI-powered teaching aid designed for legal and regulatory trainers.
Built with Streamlit, LangChain, and Groq’s LLaMA 3.1, it leverages your own PDF documents to generate accurate, context-grounded content—including Q&A, descriptive questions, scenario-based assignments, and on-demand MCQ exams (printable or LMS-ready).
Using RAG architecture with Chroma vectorstore and HuggingFace embeddings, it ensures all responses are strictly derived from your source materials—no hallucinations.
Simply upload your training manuals, and let ANFA help you create, explain, and assess with confidence. 🛡️📚
